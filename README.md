# Face Recognition with Webcam 🎥

This project implements a simple **real-time face Recognition system** using **Python and OpenCV**.  
It captures video from a webcam and draws a **green bounding box** around detected faces.

> Project goal: Learn computer vision basics, webcam handling, and real-time face detection.
